# Personal Self-Hosted Website

Welcome to [spacewind.xyz](http://spacewind.xyz), my self-hosted website! This project is hosted entirely on my Ubuntu laptop and serves as a platform for personal use as well as a space to experiment with new ideas and technologies.

## Overview

This website is a personal initiative to combine my day-to-day needs with my passion for learning and experimenting. It is self-hosted, providing me complete control over the hosting environment, and acts as a playground for testing innovative concepts.

## Purpose and Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:

1. **Personal Use**: The website includes tools, resources, and functionality tailored to my personal requirements.
2. **Experimentation**: It serves as a sandbox for trying out and implementing new ideas, concepts, and technologies.
3. **Skill Development**: A platform for improving my skills in web development, hosting, and system management.

## Features

- **Custom Hosting**: The website is hosted locally on my Ubuntu laptop, making it a highly customized and personal environment.
- **Accessible via Custom Domain**: The website can be accessed at [spacewind.xyz](http://spacewind.xyz).
- **Dynamic Content**: A continually evolving space for ideas and experiments.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Since it is self-hosted, the data is entirely under my control.

## Technology Stack

## Learning Goals

This project allows me to:

- Deepen my understanding of web hosting and server management.
- Explore and implement new technologies in a real-world context.
- Build and refine tools and features to suit my personal needs.
- Experiment with new ideas in web development in a safe and controlled environment.

## Future Plans

I am continuously looking to improve and expand this website. Some of the upcoming plans include:

- Adding new and innovative features.
- Enhancing the website's design and user experience.
- Exploring automation and containerization solutions like Docker.
- Potentially open-sourcing parts of the project to share my experience with the community.

## Notes

This website is a personal project and is not intended for public use. It is a reflection of my journey in learning and experimenting with web hosting and development.
